**Exit status 1** is used in some error messages to indicate that a process has finished (or "exited") in failure. Other parts of the error message will often contain more specific information.

Your error output may end with one of these lines:

* `Compilation error: exit status 1`. See [If your sketch doesn't compile](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4402764401554-Compilation-errors-when-uploading).
* `Failed uploading: uploading error: exit status 1`. See [Errors when uploading a sketch](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4403365313810-Errors-when-uploading-a-sketch).


If your error only reads `exit status 1`, or if you have a different error, click the ![Verify button](img/symbol_verify2.png) **Verify** button:

* If you still get an error, it occurs during **compilation**. See [If your sketch doesn't compile](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4402764401554-Compilation-errors-when-uploading).
* If it passes with a `Compilation complete` message, the error occurs during **upload**. See [Errors when uploading a sketch](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4403365313810-Errors-when-uploading-a-sketch).
