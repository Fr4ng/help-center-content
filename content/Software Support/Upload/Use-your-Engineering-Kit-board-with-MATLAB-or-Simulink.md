## If your board isn't being detected by MATLAB or Simulink

Arduino IDE can be used to install the required drivers:

1. [Download and install the latest version of Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020).

2. Install the **Arduino SAMD Boards** package. If you need help, see [Add boards to Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360016119519-Add-boards-to-Arduino-IDE).

3. Install the **ArduinoMotorCarrier** library. If you need help, see [Add libraries to Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/5145457742236-Add-libraries-to-Arduino-IDE).

4. Restart your computer.

5. Try using your board with MATLAB or Simulink again.

6. If the issue persists, try reinstalling the MATLAB or Simulink application by following the [above instructions](#install).
