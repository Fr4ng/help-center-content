---

Bluetooth 4.0 includes both traditional Bluetooth (Bluetooth Classic), and Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE, or BLE). BLE is optimized for low power use at low data rates.

Some Arduino boards that are hardware enabled for Bluetooth 4.0 and BLE include:

* Nano 33 BLE
* Nano 33 BLE Sense
* Nano 33 IoT
* Nano RP2040 Connect
* MKR WiFi 1010
* UNO WiFi Rev 2
