title: "Can I use BLE and Wi-Fi at the same time?"
---

The built-in communication chipset on some Arduino boards such as the Nano 33 IoT allows for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi functionality.

Since both BLE and Wi-Fi use the same hardware, they cannot be used simultaneously. If using both in your project, you have to switch between them.
