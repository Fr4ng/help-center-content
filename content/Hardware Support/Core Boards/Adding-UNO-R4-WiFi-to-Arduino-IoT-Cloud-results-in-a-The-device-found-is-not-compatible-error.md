title: Adding UNO R4 WiFi to Arduino IoT Cloud results in a "The device found is not compatible" error
---

When setting up **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** in IoT Cloud, you may get this message:

```
The device found is not compatible
An Arduino Uno R4 WiFi has been detected but unfortunately this kind of board cannot be used on Arduino IoT Cloud.
Executing command: exit status 1
```

We are actively working on this issue. We apologize for the delay and expect to have full IoT Cloud support for UNO R4 WiFi very soon.
