title: "About the delivery process"

<!---When the order is confirmed a email will be sent to the customer:

Subject: Order <OrderNumber> confirmed

From: Arduino Official Store support@arduino.cc

Once the goods have been shipped, the customer will receive a shipping confirmation email, including the tracking number.

Account users can see some information about their orders from https://store.arduino.cc/account, but itâ€™s much more limited:--->

It is important to note that our warehouses are closed on the weekends.
At the checkout, the exact delivery date does not include the extra processing day, which you need to count with as not all orders can be processed and shipped out on the same day they have been placed.

You can see the our order processing method:

* [For the US store](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/pages/shipping-policy)
* [For the EU store](https://store.arduino.cc/pages/shipping-policy)

title: "How long does delivery take?"
---

Delivery time changes depending on the selected carrier and destination country as indicated in the checkout phase. Carrier delivery time does not include the order processing period as mentioned in the next section. Arduino SRL cannot be held responsible for the Carrier's late deliveries. Once the goods have been shipped, the customer will receive a shipping confirmation email, including the tracking number.

title: "About possible additional fees charged by the carrier"
---

Occasionally, your carrier might request the payment of additional fees due to the customs clearance process performed at the parcel's destination country.

For orders placed on Arduino's EU store, customs fees might occur for parcels shipped to countries outside the European Union. Similarly, the same might happen for orders placed on Arduino's US store and delivered to an area outside the USA.

The customs fees are regulated by the local authorities in the destination country. That fact makes it impossible to predict if you will be charged customs fees when ordering a product from the Arduino store.

Beware that the ordered parcel will be returned to Arduino's warehouse if this fee is not paid to the carrier.

>Note: Even though it is impossible to predict if additional fees will occur, in some cases, although being slower, deliveries made by postal services are less likely to be charged customs fees.

title: "My parcel did not arrive, what can I do?"

Unfortunately, there are some cases when, even if the tracking number shows that the parcel has been delivered, it has not been delivered to the hands of the customer. This mostly happens with the parcels, where a signature is not required.

If this happened to you, please check the following before you make contact with Arduino Customer Support:

* Check with other people living in your same address, or perhaps a neighbor, to make sure that nobody picked up your package.
* Check around the entrance(s) of your residence for the package, particularly on back porches, bushes, garages, grills, or other places that might protect your package from theft or weather.

> Note that drivers may also use plastic bags to protect your package from the weather.

If you have tried all this and your parcel has still not been found, you can
make contact with Arduino Customer Support to find a solution for your problem.
