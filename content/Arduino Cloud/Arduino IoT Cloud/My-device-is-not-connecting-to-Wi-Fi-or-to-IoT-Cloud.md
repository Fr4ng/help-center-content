title: "My device is not connecting to Wi-Fi or to IoT Cloud"

Since this is a quite generic error, please check the following common causes:

* Check if your Wi-Fi credentials are correct.

* Check if you have configured the board you are using: you can see all of your configured devices in the [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot).

* Be sure your device has enough power supply; sometimes peripherals attached to the board require too much power and the board operations get compromised.

* Try to update the Wi-Fi module firmware if you have not the latest version installed on your board. You can follow [this tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/FirmwareUpdater/) for updating the firmware of MKR1000 boards or [this tutorial](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360013896579-How-to-update-the-WiFi-Nina-and-WiFi101-firmware) for boards with WiFi Nina and Wifi101 communication modules.
