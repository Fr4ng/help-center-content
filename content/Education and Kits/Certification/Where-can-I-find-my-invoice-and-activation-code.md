When you purchase the Arduino certification, you will receive two emails:

* One email containing a purchase receipt.
* One email with the subject line "Thank you for purchasing Arduino Certification!". **This contains your certification code**.

If you cannot find the email, try checking your spam folder.

If you still need help, [contact us](https://www.arduino.cc/en/contact-us/).
