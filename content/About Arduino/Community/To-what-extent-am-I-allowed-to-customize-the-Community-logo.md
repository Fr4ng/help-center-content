The community logo is designed to allow personalization in the lower-right part in order to provide a free space to add the name of your group or organization on.

Apart from that the community logo should not be altered, cropped, shortened or modified in any way. It is not allowed to incorporate another logo, trademark or commercial company name into the community logo.
