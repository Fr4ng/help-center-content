title: "I developed a course that uses Arduino technology. Can I commercialize it, or does it have to be free?"

Yes, you are free to sell your educational courses. However, you cannot name your course in a way that suggests the course is officially endorsed, approved, or certified by Arduino. Furthermore, you are not allowed to use trademarked Arduino logos to identify the course.
