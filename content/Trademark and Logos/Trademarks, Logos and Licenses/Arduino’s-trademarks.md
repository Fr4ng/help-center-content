title: "Arduino's Trademarks"
---

A trademark is a word or symbol representing a company or product. It is intended to identify a specific source of goods or services, protecting that source from confusion in the minds of consumers with other sources. Trademarks are recognizable because they are followed by the symbols ™ or ®.

Most hardware designs of Arduino are open-source, however the company name and logos are not. Anyone is allowed to copy and to further develop our open source products into their own thing as long as the name Arduino, the infinity logotype and other trademarks are respected.
Arduino's trademark portfolio also includes other trademarks that may apply differently depending on geographic region. We recommend that you check national trademark search engines or email [trademark@arduino.cc](trademark@arduino.cc) when uncertain of what applies in your region.

One of the most important reasons for having trademarks is to protect customers from counterfeit products. These are products that may look like Arduino but that are not manufactured by us. Please check this useful guide on [how to spot a counterfeit](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020652100-How-to-spot-a-counterfeit-Arduino).
