title: "Change the language in Arduino IDE"
---

The Arduino IDE uses the system default language when you install and set up the IDE. If you like to work with a different language you can always change it to a language that you are comfortable working with.

---

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Open preferences
   * Windows/Linux: `File > Preferences`.
   * macOS: `Arduino > Preferences`
3. Under Preferences, look for the Editor language option.

5. Close the IDE and reopen the IDE again to finalize the changes.
