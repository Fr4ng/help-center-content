title: "If your board runs the sketch twice"
---

The issue of the ```setup()``` function running twice when uploading a sketch has been reported in some boards.

Since a port can only be connected to one application at a time, the Arduino IDE has to close and open the port a number of times to upload a sketch while the Serial Monitor is open. This process resets the board and the program runs again.

The repeated output can be avoided in two ways:

1. If one simply wants to repeatedly run the sketch to observe the output, thereâ€™s no need to upload the (same) sketch multiple times. Just press the reset button with the Serial Monitor open.
2. The board resets after approximately 100 milliseconds. By adding `delay(150)` at the start of the `setup()` function, the board will be reset before any of the following code is executed. Increase the delay if needed.
