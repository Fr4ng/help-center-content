title: "'Error: avrdude' when uploading"
---

The tool **avrdude** is used to upload sketches to the Arduino boards which use microcontrollers of the AVR architecture. When uploading code to your board in the IDE, avrdude may give an error.

Most of these errors can be resolved by following this [general troubleshooting checklist](#check-the-following).

You can also read about these specific errors:

## General troubleshooting checklist

Most errors can be solved by following these steps. After each step, try uploading your sketch again.

1. Make sure you have [selected the right board and port](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE) correct board under _Tools > Board_ and  _Tools > Port_.

   * For instructions, see [Select board and port in Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE)

   * If your board is missing, see [If your board does not appear in the port menu](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412955149586-If-your-board-does-not-appear-in-the-port-menu)

2. Close other instances of Arduino IDE, serial monitors or other software that my be blocking the port. If this doesn't work, try restarting your computer.

3. Reset your board by pressing the RESET button (a white or blue push button).

   ![The reset button on Arduino UNO.](img/uno-reset-button.png)

4. Check port and cable connections:

   * Try disconnecting and reconnecting the board to the computer, and confirm that the power LED (usually labeled on the board "ON") is lit. On most boards, an orange LED will also blink when the board is plugged in. <!-- TODO: Simplify -->

   * If possible, connect the board directly to a USB port. Avoid using a USB hub, or try a dif

   * Make sure you are using a data transfer USB cable (charge-only cables will not work). Try connecting your board with a different cable, or testing your cable with a different device.

   * Remove any unneeded USB devices that may be using the ports.

5. Remove any connections to digital pins **0(RX)** and **1(TX)**. Anything connected to these pins can interfere with the upload transfer.

6. Press the reset button and see if the LED blinks. If the LED doesn't blink there is a high chance that the bootloader of your board is corrupted.

7. Try a complete uninstall (including deleting the [Arduino15 folder](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360018448279) of the Arduino IDE. Then reinstall the IDE using the latest version.

8. For some boards, you can do a [loopback test](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360020366520) to test the USB to serial chip. If the loopback test passes, or if you can't do a loopback test, the bootloader may be corrupted or missing. In this case, try [burning a fresh bootloader](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/arduino-isp/ArduinoISP). The loopback test can be done with these boards:

   * Arduino Uno (classic)
   * Arduino Uno Rev3 <!-- [X] Tested 2022-03-24 -->
   * Arduino Uno Rev3 SMD <!-- [X] Tested 2022-03-24 -->
   * Arduino Mega (classic)
   * Arduino Mega2560 Rev3
   * Arduino Mega ADK Rev3
   * Arduino Nano (classic) <!-- [X] Tested 2022-03-24 -->

1. Make sure you have [selected the right board and port](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE) correct board under _Tools > Board_ and  _Tools > Port_.

   * For instructions, see [Select board and port in Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4406856349970-Select-board-and-port-in-Arduino-IDE)

   * If your board is missing, see [If your board does not appear in the port menu](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4412955149586-If-your-board-does-not-appear-in-the-port-menu)

This error can occur when the selected port has no board. For example, the Bluetooth<sup>Â®</sup> port might be selected instead of the USB port where the Arduino board is connected.

You can select your port in `Tools > Port: "..." > Serial Ports`. The correct port may be labeled with the board name, but not always. If you are unsure which port your board is connected to, try disconnecting it. Then reconnect it, and take note if a new port appears.

> If you're using a classic Arduino Nano you also need to [select the correct processor](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4401874304274-Select-the-right-processor-for-Arduino-Nano).
